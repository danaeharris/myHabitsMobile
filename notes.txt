Two ways to update your app once it's in the app store:

• expo build:ios > builds you an .ipa file (or .apk for Android) that you upload to the App Store and submit for review.
   • Goes through the full review process, takes a day or two.
   • Users get this update when they update from the App Store.

• expo publish: Pushes an over-the-air update to installed apps without a new App Store submission.
    • No app store review.
    • Users close and re-open their app.
